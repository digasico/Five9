Not sure if I understand the question, but as far as I know or could find, there are no tools that do that automatically, so if I had to guarantee such a thing, I would start by exporting both databases and manually comparing them, looking for differences. Obviously, this needs to be automated, but since there is no such tool, I guess I would have to make one that would translate from one database environment to the other and then compare both.
